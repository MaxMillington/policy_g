Thanks for viewing my app. In order to get it running, simply clone it down and bundle. Run the server with rails s and run the tests with rspec. There is one user built in, username: Person, password: password. Run rake db:setup to populate the seed data and run the database migrations. You may also create you own user with the signup button.
